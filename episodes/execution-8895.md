  Pétale Défoule is an album that opens with an intriguing 'Intro' and features tracks like 'Barbarie' and 'Slurpdub'. The album is a mix of heavy breaked bass, stepper accents, and dnb influences. Larsen's work is described as epic and percussive, blending with smooth melodies and virtuoso synths.
